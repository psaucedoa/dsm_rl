[ ] Rewrite stuff more nice now that it kinda works
[ ] Add in friction
    - Height of blade vs height of upcoming soil?
    - Height of blade vs 'Amount of Soil' (sum of soil in front of blade?)
[x] Add tracking of absolute blade height
[ ] Add delay in blade control
    - When avg terrain height updates, delay update to absolute blade height
    - When blade set height updates, delay update to absolute blade height
    - Maybe just buffer the updates from ANY source?
[ ] Add in variable 'weight', randomized per soil
[ ] Add yaw blade control

bugs
[x] not propagating the correct numbers (some soil gets lost or magically appears)
    - Was actually problem with some transforms I was calculating. Sines and Cosines were wrong, basically.
