[ ] Rewrite stuff more nice now that it kinda works
[ ] Add in friction
    - Height of blade vs height of upcoming soil?
    - Height of blade vs 'Amount of Soil' (sum of soil in front of blade?)
        - could do this by maybe taking the average amount of soil in front and above the blade?
[x] Add tracking of absolute blade height
[ ] Add delay in blade control
    - When avg terrain height updates, delay update to absolute blade height
    - When blade set height updates, delay update to absolute blade height
    - Maybe just buffer the updates from ANY source?
[ ] Add in variable 'weight', randomized per soil
[x] Add yaw blade control

bugs
[x] not propagating the correct numbers (some soil gets lost or magically appears)
    - Was actually problem with some transforms I was calculating. Sines and Cosines were wrong, basically.
[x] blade yaw flips when moving backwards
    - issue with how I do blade interaction offsets depending on direction
    - kinda resolved by just flipping the angle when moving backwards lmao
[/]  soil explodes (again) when blade is yawed with some soil accumulated on the edge that's pulled back.
    - probably some math error where either the blade interactions or deposit locations are stacked on top of each other?
    - yeah, and it was caused by `direction` being zero when there was no movement, removing the offsets of deposits and cuts
    - kinda fixed? there's still some weirdness, like continuous vortex shedding almost, but it's not exploding so w/e
